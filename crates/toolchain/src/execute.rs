//! Running a plan. The only file in this crate that touches the machine.
//!
//! Everything worth testing was decided before control reached here: which
//! packages, in what order, wrapped in which elevation. What remains is
//! spawning a process and reading an exit code, and the exit codes are the part
//! that matters — a dismissed prompt and a failed install must not arrive as
//! the same outcome.
//!
//! **Unverified.** This host has no Linux and no elevated session, so neither
//! the `pkexec` path nor a real UAC prompt has been executed. The mapping below
//! is written from the documented codes, not from having watched them.

//! Making a decision take effect.
//!
//! [`policy`](crate::policy) decides and explains; this module is the only
//! place that changes anything. Two levers, and deliberately only two:
//!
//! * **holding off sleep**, through each platform's intended mechanism; and
//! * **process scheduling priority**, which changes what the operating system
//!   does when two things want the processor at once.
//!
//! # What is not here, and why
//!
//! There is no power-plan or power-overlay lever. `powercfg` on Windows can set
//! an active scheme, and it would have been the shortest way to make a
//! "Performance" button look like it did something — but a machine on a custom
//! or vendor-managed plan either ignores it or has its user's own configuration
//! silently replaced. Both outcomes are worse than not having the control:
//! one is a lie, the other is damage. The same reasoning rules out touching
//! clocks, voltages or power limits, which belong to a hardware utility rather
//! than to something that hosts projects.
//!
//! Neither lever here can terminate a workload. That is the property that makes
//! them the right two: the worst a wrong decision can do is leave a project
//! scheduled lower than ideal, which is slow, not dead.
//!
//! # Why priority is set by running a command
//!
//! Changing another process's priority is a platform API call on every
//! operating system, and this workspace forbids `unsafe`. The alternative to
//! shelling out would be a dependency that wraps those calls; each one carries
//! more surface than the two commands below, for a change that happens at most
//! once every few minutes per project. `renice` and PowerShell's
//! `PriorityClass` are the platforms' own supported interfaces to exactly this.

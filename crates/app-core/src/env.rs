//! A project's environment, as the process it starts will see it.
//!
//! This is the composition point for two things that deliberately know nothing
//! about each other: `database`'s `environment` module, which stores a value as
//! either plaintext or ciphertext and never decides which, and `security`,
//! which can decrypt but has no idea what a project is.
//!
//! # Why this exists at all
//!
//! Host projects were started with an empty environment. Everything a user had
//! configured on the project's settings screen — a database URL, an API key, a
//! bot token — was written to the database, displayed back in the interface,
//! and then not passed to the process. A Discord bot reading
//! `process.env.DISCORD_TOKEN` got `undefined` and failed to log in, and
//! nothing in the interface suggested why, because the variable was plainly
//! there on the screen.
//!
//! # What a process does and does not inherit
//!
//! The child inherits this process's environment and has the project's
//! variables laid over the top. That is the behaviour a person expects from
//! running the command themselves in a terminal: `PATH` and `HOME` are there,
//! and what they configured wins over what they did not.
//!
//! Secrets are decrypted here, held only as long as it takes to build the
//! command, and never logged. [`Resolved::redacted_keys`] exists so a caller
//! can say *which* variables were applied without being able to say what is in
//! them.

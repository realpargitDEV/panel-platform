//! Connecting the power manager to the projects it is managing.
//!
//! The `power` crate deliberately knows nothing about databases, supervisors or
//! Discord — it is handed a list of running processes and returns a decision.
//! This module is the translation, and it is the only place that knows both
//! halves.
//!
//! # Where each field comes from
//!
//! A project's pid is only knowable from its supervisor handle, and its
//! priority and keep-awake setting are only knowable from its row. Neither
//! source can answer alone, so a tick reads the registry first — that being the
//! authority on what is *actually running* — and then looks up the rows for
//! exactly those projects. Doing it the other way round would mean reading
//! every row on the machine every two seconds to find the two that are up.

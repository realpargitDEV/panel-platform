//! Application core: configuration, logging, lifecycle, shared state.
//!
//! This crate owns everything the application does that is not the user
//! interface. It deliberately has no dependency on Tauri, so all of it can be
//! tested with `cargo test` and none of it needs a window.
//!
//! The desktop app in `apps/desktop` is a thin shell: it starts a [`Runtime`],
//! hands the resulting [`AppState`] to Tauri, and exposes commands that call
//! into the domain crates. There is no server, no port and no login, because
//! there is nothing to authenticate to — the process runs as the user, on the
//! user's own machine, and can already do anything the user can.

//! Keeping the stored status equal to what is actually happening.
//!
//! Without this module the database is only ever written at the moment a
//! lifecycle call returns. A project started at nine o'clock and killed by its
//! own bug at ten past reads `RUNNING` until somebody presses a button — which
//! is exactly the failure the request names: *do not show Running just because
//! a start button was clicked.*
//!
//! Two jobs, and they are different enough to be separate functions:
//!
//! * [`at_startup`] runs once, before the window opens. The supervisor registry
//!   is empty by definition at that point — a handle owns a child of *this*
//!   process — so any row claiming to be up is describing a process from a
//!   previous run that is gone.
//! * [`sweep`] runs on a timer for as long as the application does, and carries
//!   what each live supervisor observed into the row.
//!
//! # Why no pid is ever adopted
//!
//! The request asks for reconciliation that never trusts an old pid, because
//! operating systems reuse them. This design cannot make that mistake: nothing
//! anywhere writes a pid to the database. A supervisor handle is the only thing
//! that knows a pid, it lives in memory, and it dies with the process that
//! spawned the child. A previous run's projects are therefore *known* to be
//! gone rather than checked for — which is a stronger guarantee than any
//! amount of careful pid validation, and it is the reason host projects are
//! stopped on the way out instead of being detached.

//! Spawning a child that can be ended along with everything it spawned.
//!
//! The problem this exists to solve: `npm start` spawns `node`. Killing `npm`
//! leaves `node` running and holding the port, and the next start then fails
//! with a port conflict that has no visible cause. A project is a process
//! *tree*, and the tree is what has to be ended.
//!
//! # Why this is not done the usual way
//!
//! The usual answers are a Windows Job Object and a `setsid`/`killpg` pair, and
//! both need FFI. The workspace sets `unsafe_code = "forbid"`, which an `allow`
//! at crate or module level cannot downgrade, and there is no `unsafe` anywhere
//! in the tree. So this uses only what is safe:
//!
//! - **Windows** — [`CommandExt::creation_flags`] with `CREATE_NEW_PROCESS_GROUP`
//!   at spawn, and `taskkill /T` to walk the tree.
//! - **Unix** — [`CommandExt::process_group`], stable since Rust 1.64 and safe,
//!   and the `kill` program to signal the negated group id.
//!
//! Shelling out to `taskkill` and `kill` is not elegant. It is the only way to
//! reach this capability without FFI, and the alternative — an `unsafe` block,
//! or a dependency that hides one — was rejected when the rule was written.
//!
//! # What "graceful" means here, honestly
//!
//! On Unix it means `SIGTERM`, which is the real thing.
//!
//! On Windows there is no equivalent for a console process without
//! `GenerateConsoleCtrlEvent`, which is FFI. `taskkill` without `/F` posts
//! `WM_CLOSE`, which a console application ignores. So on Windows the grace
//! period is a genuine wait — the child gets it, and most children that were
//! going to exit on their own will — but the polite signal at the start of it
//! does not reach a console process. What actually ends it is the forced kill at
//! the end. This is a real limitation and it is written down rather than papered
//! over.
//!
//! [`CommandExt::creation_flags`]: std::os::windows::process::CommandExt::creation_flags
//! [`CommandExt::process_group`]: std::os::unix::process::CommandExt::process_group
